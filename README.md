# How to Run

## API

Double check you are in the API directory.

Install bun if you don't have it installed yet. You can install it using npm, or following the instructions here: https://bun.sh/.

Then, install the dependencies using npm or other package manager of your choice:

```bash
bun install
```

Now, you can run the API with:

```bash
bun run src/index.ts
```

This will launch the API on port 8080.

## Front End

Double check you are in the FrontEnd directory.

Then, install the dependencies using npm or other package manager of your choice:

```bash
npm install
```

Now, you can run the app with:

```bash
npm run dev
```
